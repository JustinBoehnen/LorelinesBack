# Lorelines Web Application Back-end
Lorelines is the junior project (CST 316, CST 326, CST 336) of Justin Boehnen, Evan Clark, Seth Ray, and Isacc Medlin (J.E.S.I.)

### Lorelines
Lorelines is a web app wherin users can organize every minute detail of the project or story they are creating. Lorelines accomplishes this feat with a powerful feature set including:
- Template creation and instantiation (custom entities)
- Inter-entity referencing (entities can reference eachother)
- Automatic grouping and organizing of entities
- Timeline creation with entity referencing and entity time-states (entities have their history tracked)
- User profiles with cloud data persistence (develop your story anywhere)
- and more!

This back-end was implemented with Express.js.
